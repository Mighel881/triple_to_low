#TripleToLow

Basically, if you have this installed, it'll toggle low power mode whenever you triple click the home button. You do, however, have to already have some option selected to run (in settings > accessibility > accessibility shortcut) whenever you triple click the home button. I'm working on fixing that.
I plan to increase functionality of this tweak until it has a bunch of options to activate when you triple/double press the home button. Like that part of activator but much more lightweight
